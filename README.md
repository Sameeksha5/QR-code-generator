# QR-code-generator(Algorithm)
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Input:

Step 3: Take the data you want to encode in the QR code.
Initialize Parameters:

Step 4: Set the size of the QR code matrix.
Define the border size.
Create a Blank Matrix:

Step 5: Create a blank square matrix (image) with a white background.
Calculate Square Size:

Step 6: Determine the size of each QR code square based on the matrix size, excluding the border.
Data Encoding:

Step 7: Represent the data as a binary pattern.
The binary pattern should follow the QR code specification.
Draw QR Code:

Step 9: Traverse the matrix and draw black squares for each '1' in the binary pattern.
Use the calculated square size and border to position the squares.
Output:

Step 10: Save or display the generated QR code image.
Step 11: End
